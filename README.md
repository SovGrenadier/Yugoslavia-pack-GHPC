# Yugoslavian M-84A

How to install:

1. Requires MelonLoader, instructions for download here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbIHolAu5CE at roughly 0:34. Melonloader is found on github through a simple search.
2. Download the latest release (Watch for updates, they're frequent.)
3. Drop the .dll in the mod folder of your GHPC game.
4. Run the .exe directly from the game directory. *IT WILL NOT WORK THORUGH STEAM!*

This mod will replace every T-72M1, or optionally the T-72M as well, with an M-84A.
For questions, contact me in the GHPC discord with the username SwissAdmiral.
This is a preliminary mod for what will hopefully eventually be a full fledged Yugoslavia mod.
This mod is incompatible with my T72B mod, as they both try to replace the T72M1.

In order to use the provided optional livery, you must:
1. Download the PNG livery of latest release and AssetBundleExtractor from Github. Just search for it.
2. File>Open
3. Select the sharedassets1.assets file from your GHPC directory, usually found in something like ThisPC>LocalDisk>ProgramFiles(x86)>Steam>steamapps>GHPC>Bin>GHPC_Data
4. Sort the files in AssetBundleExtractor by name to make it more convienent.
5. Go to View>Search and type in T72, case sensitive
6. Select the T72A_co file and click Plugins>Edit
7. Load>M84_Livery. Press OK. Ensure that the texture format is set to DXT5. Quality should be set to normal.
8. File>Apply and Save all, save the new assets file in a different folder, ensure that you put .assets at the end of the file name.
9. Paste the assets file back into your GHPC_Data folder, allow it to replace the existing file.
10. Run your game and enjoy.
