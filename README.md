# Yugoslavian Vehicles Pack

How to install:

1. Requires MelonLoader, instructions for download here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbIHolAu5CE at roughly 0:34. Melonloader is found on github through a simple search.
2. Download the latest release (Watch for updates, they're frequent.)
3. Drop the .dll in the mod folder of your GHPC game.
4. Run the .exe directly from the game directory. *IT WILL NOT WORK THORUGH STEAM!*

This mod will replace every T-72M with an M-84A, every T72M1 will become an M91 Vihor, and every BMP2 becomes an M80A.
For questions, contact me in the GHPC discord with the username SwissAdmiral.

Reccomended additionals:
